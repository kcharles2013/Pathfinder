This is a pathfinding web application.

A maze building algorithm is used to randomly carve out a maze within the grid.

The primary path finding algorithm used to find the quickest route from the start point to the end point is the 
a-star algorithm.

Starting out the user has two options:

    1.Press the 'Build Labyrinth' button to generate a maze with a start and end point.
        - The user can then press the 'A-Star Algo' button to simulate the quickest route.

    2. The user can press the 'Start Block' button to select a start point, folloed by doing the same with the 'End Block'
        - The user can choose which blocks will be assigned as 'Wall Blocks'
        - Once the grid is as the user desires, they can proceed to pressing the 'A-Star Algo' to initate the 
        - pathfinding algorithm.
